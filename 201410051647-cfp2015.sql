By paying close attention to how domain experts (people intimately familiar with how a specific part of a business actually runs) you will start learning critical information that you can use to help ensure that your code more accurately models the business processes it represents.

Essentially it gives you three tools: service discovery (etcd), container management (Docker) and process management (fleet). This tutorial is an introduction to CoreOS from programmer\'s perspective: it will help you decide whether CoreOS is the right platform for your next project.\n\nDistributed systems are a lot of fun to build, but they are challenging to build too. And they become even more demanding when it comes to cluster management (adding/removing nodes, running configuration on some or all nodes etc).\n\nIn CoreOS, we finally have a linux distribution that is, from the very beginning, architected with massive deployments in mind. It doesn\'t provide many tools, it is limited by design. But it provides just enough tools to build highly scalable distributed systems that are also easy to manage and maintain.\n\nMassive deployments wouldn\'t be that easy if not for the OS-level virtualization, in form of isolated containers. And with an amazing Docker tool, container management is almost trivial (and lots of examples will be provided to support this argument).\n\nIn any distributed system, node communication is essential and quite cumbersome to implement. CoreOS team comes up with their own implementation of a highly-available key/value store - etcd. Again, this tutorial session will provide lots of examples on how to use it.\n\nFinally, to manage the lifecycle of Docker containers, another tool was introduced - fleet. While this tool is relatively low-level, it is still very handy for your cluster management and you will see why.\n\nTo sum up, this talk will provide enough examples to make an informed decision whether CoreOS (as a platform) is good choice for your next software project.
