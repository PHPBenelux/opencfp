                This OpenCFP installation will collect personal information from you for the purpose of managing talk submissions
                for a conference. The lead developer for the OpenCFP project recommends that conference organizers delete
                all records from the database being used with this installation within 15 months of accepting submissions for
                the event associated with this OpenCFP installation.

                We're also using <a class="text-white underline" href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" title="Google Analytics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Analytics</a> to get
                visitor information and to measure anonymous activity on our website. Please read the <a class="text-white underline" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en"

                In future releases tools will be provided to allow OpenCFP installations to more easily comply with the European
                General Data Protection Regulation that comes into effect on May 25, 2018. This OpenCFP installation
                currently does not provide a way to download all the information created by users of the application.

                This OpenCFP installation currently does not provide a mechanism to allow users to explicitly give
                permission for the information they have submitted to be shared with third parties or to be used
                for purposes other than managing conference speakers and conference sessions.
